      <h3>Imposter Feelings Rear Their Ugly Heads</h3>
      <h5>Nov 15, 2014</h5>
      <p>When I read the cultural assignment for this week on stereotype threat, I was pleasantly surprised. DBC never ceases to amaze me. In this post, I'll share some very personal feelings. Ready?</p>

      <p>During week 2 of Phase 0, we shared our biggest fears about starting DBC. Mine were that I wouldn't make it through the program because I wouldn't be able to cut it. Well, the truth is: I'm struggling a little bit in this program -- ok a lot bit. And, this has been hard for me because I have never struggled with anything school-related in my life.</p>

      <p> Reading about this week's cultural blog made me immediately think of the impostor's syndrome. If you're not familiar, it is the feeling that you don't belong somewhere and that eventually people around you are going to figure that out. The concept is closely related to stereotype threat, but stereotype threat is more of an externally-imposed threat that can be internalized. Impostor's syndrowe is rooted internally and typically flies in the face of the person's accomplishments...as in my case.</p>

      <p>It is a very frustrating place for me to have attended top schools, experienced professional success and to now feel most days like, well, an idiot. Am I? Most say no. Is it that my mind just doesn't work this way? That seems to be inconsistent with years of analytic experience under my belt. Maybe it's just a really steep learning curve that will plateau some? I certainly hope so. </p>

      <p>The truth is: There aren't a lot of black people in tech fields and I'm seeing that more and more as I immerse myself in the community. Are the barriers cultural or technical? Similarly, if programming is a language, not many of us are poly-lingual either. Might there be a connection? The last thing I want to do is provide evidence to support stereotypes that people of color can't cut it in tech fields. But, as a researcher, I feel the need to ask difficult questions. </p>

      <p>Personally, I'm trying not to internalize any feelings of technical inferiority. My plan is to work harder. I have concluded that this may just be a case where I've run up against a learning experience that's a bit more challenging to me. That's okay. I have reached out for help and am being open about my challenges in hopes that my cohort and others around me will be supportive. And, so far, that's what I have experienced. My major learning for this week was that it's okay to ask for and accept help. I'm fiercely indedpendent and have rarely needed or asked for help in my life. There's a first time for everything. We all need help sometimes.
