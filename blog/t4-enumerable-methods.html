      <h3>Using Ruby method, map</h3>
      <h5>Nov 3, 2014</h5>
      <p>Sometimes, Ruby methods are intuitive by their name, and sometimes not so much. Ruby method, map, is one I had to research and use to understand it and now I'm going to share.
      
      First, map is an enumerable. In other words, it's Ruby module that includes methods that allow for manipulation. Map is a manipulation method that allows you to transform elements in arrays.

      For example, what if you had an array of positive numbers that you wanted to make all negative?  You could use map to transform them.

      Map iterates over the array and performs what you specify in a block.  So, if you wrote the following code:
      
      array = [1,2,3,4,5]
      array.map{|x| -x}

      You would get the following array:

      [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5] 

      I hope this has been helpful in teaching you about map.  Map is a very useful method. Now, go try it. Enjoy!
