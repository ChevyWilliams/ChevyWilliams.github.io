We're In This Together - One Line At A Time

Oct 12, 2014

As I listened to the story of Dev Bootcamp on Shereef's Fireside Chat, I couldn't help but have a range of emotions - excitement, anxiety, humility are the main ones that come up.  It's humbling to part of such a wonderful community of human begins, because that's what we are first and that is reflected in the culture.  At DBC, everyone matters.  We all work together to create our learning community.  We bring our intellect, our drives and passions, our grit and so much more to our journey together.  DBC is the kind of community I'm proud to be a part of.

I learned about Dev Bootcamp through another like-minded community that I belong to, Experience Institute.  Ei is a year-long, self-directed program where students design their own learning plans.  I elected to spend part of my year at DBC and I'm glad I did.

Like my experience at Ei, during this first week of Phase 0, I have learned so much.  I have been challenged in ways that I haven't been in a long time and I have begun building connections.  I have to admit that I am a bit afraid of going through this program, but I don't feel alone.  And I know that's going to make all the difference.

Learning to code is not not for everyone and sometimes I even doubt if it's for me.  I know those feelings will come.  But, with every nugget I learn, I'm that much more confident in my ability to do this - one line of code at a time.
