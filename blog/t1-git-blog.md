A primer on Git and Github

A post geared toward newbies

Oct 12, 2014 

This is my first blog on Github, so bear with me.  In this blog post, I will discuss the benefits of version control, how git helps you keep track of changes, and why it is a good idea to use Github to store your code.  Along the way, I will attempt to clarify the difference between git and Github.  Let's begin.

Git is a free and open source version control software system that helps teams work together efficiently.  Have you ever worked on a team project and everyone needed to work on the same file?  If so, you've likely come across the issue of figuring out how to do so without working sequentially (waiting for someone else to finish and passing it along to you) and not overwriting someone else's work.  Luckily, these days we have solutions for this and one example is Google Docs.  Think of git as Google Docs for coding projects.  Git allows team members to work on the same project simultaneously without over-writing each others' work and track changes and history along the way.  How does it do this?  Git allows users to create repositories (directories) with local versions of the main project (usually on Github) that can be worked on independently and then re-merged back into the main project without screwing things up.  Pretty great, huh?  Now, what's Github?  

Github is a hub where programmers can store and share their repositories and work with other people.  So, if git is Google Docs, then Github is Google Drive.  Of course, these are gross comparisons, but it should help you get the picture. 

Github is a great place to store your code for a few reasons.  First, it's free.  Second, it's an open source hub which means you have access to source code (the code behind the program) that you can do pretty much whatever you want with (there are some variations in licenses).  Having access to source code allows you to see other people's code and learn how programs work. Third, it's a powerful hub to help you manage your work, which is important for programmers.

A big part of learning to code is understanding your tools.  I hope this blog post has been helpful.
